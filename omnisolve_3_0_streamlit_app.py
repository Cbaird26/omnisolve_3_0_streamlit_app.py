    ### Understanding the Evolution of the Universe Simulation
    #### Time Step Explanation
    A time step in a simulation is a discrete interval of time over which the state of the system is updated. In cosmological simulations, time steps represent incremental units of cosmic time, allowing us to model the evolution of the universe over a given period.
    
    #### The Model and the Slight Bend
    The model we used for the evolution of the universe in a matter-dominated era is based on the Friedmann equations. The scale factor \(a(t)\) describes how distances in the universe expand over time. For a matter-dominated universe, the scale factor \(a(t)\) follows a power-law relation:
    
    \[ a(t) \propto t^{2/3} \]
    
    This relation means that as cosmic time \(t\) increases, the scale factor grows as \(t^{2/3}\).
    
    #### Key Points About the Simulation:
    - **Initial Conditions**: At early times (small \(t\)), the scale factor grows slowly because the universe is young and compact.
    - **Later Times**: As time progresses, the scale factor increases more rapidly. However, because it's a \(t^{2/3}\) relationship, the growth rate isn't linear but rather follows a curve. This causes the slight bend or curve in the graph.
    
    #### The Slight Bend
    The slight bend you observe in the graph of the universe's evolution over 1000 time steps is a manifestation of the \(t^{2/3}\) relationship. Hereâ€™s what it means:
    - **Early Times**: Initially, the universe's expansion was slower.
    - **Later Times**: As time progresses, the universe expands more quickly.
    - **Non-linear Growth**: The curve represents non-linear growth typical of the matter-dominated era.
    
    ### What We Now Know:
    - **Cosmic Expansion**: The universe expands, and the rate of expansion depends on the dominant form of energy or matter. In the matter-dominated era, the expansion follows the \(t^{2/3}\) rule.
    - **Cosmological Models**: The simple power-law model helps us understand the large-scale structure of the universe. More detailed models may include other factors like dark energy, radiation, and more.
    - **Simulation Limitations**: While the simple model gives a good approximation, more sophisticated models would involve solving the full Friedmann equations considering various components (dark matter, dark energy, radiation).
